Game theory applied on device-to-device resource scheduling

The OMNeT++ simulator + simuLTE framework are used to simulate device-to-device capable LTE networks.   
Different scheduling algorithms with game theoretic roots are tested and evaluated for key performance indicators such as system throughput, packet delay and user satistfaction.
